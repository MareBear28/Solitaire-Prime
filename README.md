## How to play Solitaire Prime 💡
1. Check top card by placing it face up on the table.
2. Find the value of the card (Ace = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, ... , Jack = 10, Queen = 10, King = 10)
3. Add the value of the card to the sum. (Game starts with the sum as 0)
4. Check if the sum is a prime number:
    - If sum is a prime number, discard the pile of cards on the table, reset sum to be 0, and start over at step 1.
    - If sum is NOT a prime number, DO NOT discard the pile and continue on step 1.
4. Continue to play until there are no more cards in the deck. 
    - If your last pile's sum is a prime number, then you win! If the sum is NOT a prime number, then you lose.
